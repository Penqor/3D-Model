    <h1>My Model</h1>

    <p>My Model shows the design elements of size, shape and colour. I tested my model both in VR using the school's HTC Vive and in Sketchfab. Sketchfab allowed me to bring my model into my website so I could display it. I believe that my model is fit for purpose as it was created at a near profesional quality and I am able to present it in my website. I was able to embed my model into HTML because of Sketchfab. When I put my model onto Sketchfab it gave me an option to copy some code that allowed me to embed my model into my website. I don't believe that there are any legal or ethical issues with my model.</p>
